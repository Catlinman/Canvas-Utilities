# Canvas Utilities #

This is a simple Javascript utility library I mainly wrote to make working with canvas during game-jam events a little easier. It currently includes an extension of the default built-in Math library as well as an implementation of a simplified input system. The input system makes handling of key and mouse presses easier as well as the methods as to getting the position of the mouse cursor on the currently focused canvas element.
