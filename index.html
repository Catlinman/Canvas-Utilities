				"The floor seems odd here. Is there something beneath the surface?"
				</br>
				The premise is simple: The ground of each level will break after a certain amount of time. Every time you descend through the ground the world you find yourself in grows bigger and more intricate. Your only help is a strange orb that follows you around
				everywhere you go. It seems it gives off light equivalent to your lifeforce. Even though you feel the strange comfort of your new trusty follower you are still wary of what lies below. As you descend the dangers become more and
				more visible. You have no choice but to face the <strike>slime</strike> evil that lurks in the depths.
				</br>
				</br>
				Can you survive?
